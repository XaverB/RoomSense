# RoomSense
Monitoring of Room Temperature and Air Quality

To efficiently monitor room conditions, rooms are equipped with sensors for temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2). These sensors continuously capture data, which is collected by an Arduino and transmitted to a central server using the MQTT protocol. The captured data is accessible through a user-friendly web application. This platform not only enables _(near)_ real-time monitoring, but also provides automated recommendations for optimal ventilation times, based on the current air quality and temperature. In addition to the web application, users can directly receive recommendations for the next ventilation time via a specially developed Alexa skill, accessed by voice command. This increases the comfort and accessibility of the data for all users.

Another feature is an alarm system that is activated when critical air quality values are reached. This alarm warns the occupants of potentially hazardous conditions and suggests immediate measures to improve the indoor air quality.

## IOT Device Specifications

### Microcontroller Board
- We use the Arduino Uno R3, a popular open-source microcontroller board.
- The Arduino Uno R3 features an ATmega328P microcontroller and provides Wi-Fi connectivity to establish an internet connection.

### Sensors

#### Temperature and Humidity Sensor: DHT11
- The DHT11 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor.
- It provides reliable temperature and humidity readings with good accuracy.
- Detailed information on the DHT11 sensor pinout, features, and datasheet can be found on [Components101.com](https://components101.com/sensors/dht11-temperature-sensor#:~:text=The%20DHT11%20is%20a%20commonly,and%20humidity%20as%20serial%20data.).

#### Gas Sensor: MQ-135
- The MQ-135 is a gas sensor that can detect a variety of gases, such as NH3, NOx, alcohol, benzene, smoke, and CO2.
- It is a cost-effective solution for monitoring air quality.
- More information on the MQ-135 gas sensor module can be found on the [AZ-Delivery website](https://www.az-delivery.de/products/mq-135-gas-sensor-modul).

By using the Arduino Uno R3 as the microcontroller board and integrating the DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor and MQ-135 gas sensor, this IOT device can effectively monitor environmental conditions and air quality.

## Message Formats

The system uses the following MQTT topics to publish sensor data:

**Humidity**
```
room/RAUM_NAME/humidity
Payload:
{
  "device": "asdasd",
  "value": 31.5,
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss"
}
```

**Temperature**
```
room/RAUM_NAME/temperature
Payload:
{
  "device": "asdasd",
  "value": 22.3,
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss"
}
```

**CO2**

```
room/RAUM_NAME/co2
Payload:
{
  "device": "asdasd",
  "value": 650,
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss"
}
```

Replace `RAUM_NAME` with the name of the specific room being monitored.

The payload for each message includes the following fields:

- `device`: The unique identifier of the sensor device
- `value`: The measured value for the respective metric

2. Sensor: Represents a sensor installed in a room. It has attributes like id, type (temperature or CO2), and a foreign key referencing the associated room.
3. Reading: Represents a sensor reading. It has attributes like id, a foreign key referencing the sensor, the measured value, and a timestamp.
4. User: Represents a user of the web application. It has attributes like id, username, email, and password.

## Web API

### Recommendation logic

1. The method considers additional factors such as room occupancy status, outside temperature, and outside CO2 level to provide more context-aware recommendations.
2. The `GetRoomOccupancyStatus` method is introduced to determine whether a room is currently occupied or unoccupied. This information can be obtained from occupancy sensors or scheduling data. In this example, it assumes the room is always occupied for simplicity.
3. The `GetOutsideTemperature` method is introduced to retrieve the current outside temperature. This information can be obtained from a weather API or other external sources. In this example, it assumes a constant outside temperature of 20Â°C for simplicity.
4. The `GetOutsideCo2Level` method is introduced to retrieve the current outside CO2 level. This information can be obtained from an air quality API or other external sources. In this example, it assumes a constant outside CO2 level of 400 ppm for simplicity.
5. The recommendation message is generated based on the following logic:
   - If the temperature is high, the temperature trend exceeds the threshold, and the room is occupied:
     - If the outside temperature is lower than the room temperature, it recommends opening windows to allow cooler outside air to enter the room.
     - If the outside temperature is higher or equal to the room temperature, it recommends turning on air conditioning to cool down the room.
   - If the CO2 level is high, the CO2 trend exceeds the threshold, and the room is occupied:
     - If the outside CO2 level is lower than the room CO2 level, it recommends opening windows to allow fresh air to enter the room.
     - If the outside CO2 level is higher or equal to the room CO2 level, it recommends turning on the ventilation system to circulate air and reduce CO2 levels.
6. The generated recommendation message is added to the recommendation object along with the current temperature and CO2 level values.

This recommendation processing logic takes into account additional factors such as room occupancy status, outside temperature, and outside CO2 level to provide more targeted and context-aware recommendations for improving indoor air quality and comfort.

Please note that the `GetRoomOccupancyStatus`, `GetOutsideTemperature`, and `GetOutsideCo2Level` methods are placeholders in this example, and you would need to implement the actual logic to retrieve the relevant data based on your specific requirements and available data sources.
